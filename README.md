About
----
Our website helps you discover, save, and organize your favorite recipes. Use our powerful search feature to find recipes based on ingredients you have. Save recipes to your personal collection and organize them into categories for easy access.

Purpose
----
This was the final project we created as part of the bootcamp where we learned how to work as a team of 4 to build an app. We had morning stand-ups, effectively used branches, merged correctly on Git, resolved conflicts together, and brought an idea from inception to a final product.

Challenges
----
We used Tom Select for the search bar form to be able to take multiple input requests and narrow down the search based on the ingredients users have on hand. We also have a review section where users can post their reviews and save to favorites. This was a hard task to complete and required us to change and update our DB schema, models, and API keys, but we eventually figured it out as a team.

Next Steps
----
We absolutely love our product and we would like to update the background image. We also plan to create a mobile version of our app in the future as it is currently only available on desktop.
